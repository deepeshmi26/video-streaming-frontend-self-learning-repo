# Chapter 01 â€” Media Source Extensions (MSE) Demo

In this chapter, we experiment with the **MediaSource API**, which allows JavaScript to directly feed video/audio segments into a `<video>` element.

---

## What MSE solves
- Plays video in **small segments**, instead of one large MP4 file.
- Enables **adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR)** when combined with logic to pick the right segments.
- Allows efficient seeking and live streaming.
- Foundation for streaming protocols like **HLS** and **DASH**.

## Challenges Faced

- **CORS Issues**: Encountered cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) problems when trying to fetch video segments from different domains. Using directly in video tag works fine
- **Setup Complexity**: The initial setup and configuration of MSE was challenging and required careful handling.
- **Segment Ordering**: Streaming with basic fetch calls proved difficult as:
  - Need to carefully manage segment order
  - Buffer appending must be done in correct sequence
  - Out-of-order segments can corrupt playback

These challenges highlight why higher-level libraries like HLS.js are preferred for production use.

## Example Code
We attach a `MediaSource` to `<video>` and append an initialization segment + media segment:

```js
const video = document.querySelector("video");
const mediaSource = new MediaSource();
video.src = URL.createObjectURL(mediaSource);

mediaSource.addEventListener("sourceopen", async () => {
  const sb = mediaSource.addSourceBuffer('video/mp4; codecs="avc1.64001e, mp4a.40.2"');
  const initSegment = await fetch("init.mp4").then(r => r.arrayBuffer());
  const mediaSegment = await fetch("seg-1.m4s").then(r => r.arrayBuffer());
  sb.appendBuffer(initSegment);
  sb.appendBuffer(mediaSegment);
});
